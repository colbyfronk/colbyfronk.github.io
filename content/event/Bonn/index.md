title: Data to Equation, Symbolic Regression with Neural ODEs

event: Hausdorff School's “Inverse problems for multi-scale models”

location: Universität Bonn

  street: HIM lecture hall
  city: Bonn
  #region: CA
  #postcode: '93117'

summary: We introduce the polynomial neural ODE, which is a deep polynomial neural network inside of the neural ODE framework. We demonstrate the capability of polynomial neural ODEs to predict outside of the training region, as well as perform direct symbolic regression without additional tools such as SINDy.
abstract: 'Neural networks have the ability to serve as universal function approximators, but they are not interpretable and don’t generalize well outside of their training region. Both of these issues are problematic when trying to apply standard neural ordinary differential equations
(neural ODEs) to dynamical systems. We introduce the polynomial neural ODE, which is a deep polynomial neural network inside of the neural ODE framework. We demonstrate the capability of polynomial neural ODEs to predict outside of the training region, as well as perform direct symbolic regression without additional tools such as SINDy.'
