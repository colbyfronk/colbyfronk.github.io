abstract: For about the last 20 years, the aerosol composition of the eastern United States has been changing as a result of two major factors 1.) anthropogenic aerosol emissions have steadily been decreasing [Doughty, 2014] and 2.) biogenic secondary organic aerosols (SOAs) emissions originating from plants have steadily increased as a result of an increase in vegetation brought about by reforestation [Barr et al., 2003]. The current impact of the changing aerosol composition defined by an increase in SOAs and a decrease in anthropogenic aerosols on the formation and growth of cloud droplets is currently unknown. In order to get a preliminary understanding, its impact on cloud microphysics will be studied by looking at KÓ§hler theory and observing how these aerosols behave in an air parcel model.

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: We develop numerical simulations to study how the formation and growth of cloud droplets changes when there is an increase in biogenic secondary organic aerosols (SOAs) emissions originating from plants and a decrease in anthropogenic aerosols.
